## 1. Introduction

Airbnb is a global platform that enables property owners to rent out their homes to travelers. With thousands of listings varying by location, price, amenities, and host types, there's a massive opportunity to use data to improve revenue generation, optimize rental strategies, and enhance guest satisfaction. This project analyzes Airbnb data to provide insights for better business decisions through a multi-page, interactive Tableau dashboard.

## 2. Business Problem

Hosts and Airbnb’s regional teams often struggle with:
- Understanding which listings perform best and why.
- Pricing properties competitively while maintaining profitability.
- Identifying the impact of host type (e.g., Superhosts) on guest ratings and revenue.
- Managing seasonal demand and optimizing listing visibility.

Without a centralized data visualization tool, it’s difficult to extract actionable insights from thousands of records.
